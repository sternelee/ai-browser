*_Note: This is an experimental early access version, as AI models improve so will Web._*

*_Note 2: The AI features require an Apple M chip._*

*_Note 3: The current version is meant to be used to play around and give feedback to gear development. It's missing key features as a browser._*

## What's working


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e16842f8-fc2a-4984-91ee-9b012bd792f5


### Core Browsing
- **WebKit Integration**: Native WebKit rendering with WKWebView
- **Tab Management**: Tab hibernation for optimal performance
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Comprehensive shortcuts (⌘T, ⌘W, ⌘R, etc.)
- **Downloads**: Built-in download manager with progress tracking (Need to test)

### Privacy & Security
- **Incognito Mode**: Private browsing sessions
- **Ad Blocking**: Integrated ad blocking service (Need to test if it can be disabled)
- **Password Management**: Secure password handling (Need to test)
- **Privacy Settings**: Granular privacy controls (Need to test)

### AI Integration
- **Local AI Models**: On-device AI powered by [Apple MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) and [MLX Swift Examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples)
- **MLX Framework**: Apple Silicon optimized inference
- **Privacy-First**: AI processing happens locally on device
- **Smart Assistance**: Integrated AI sidebar for web content analysis with TL;DR and page + history context. (Still rough with bugs, but nice to play and have fun)

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Apple Silicon Mac (for AI features)
- Xcode 15.0+ (for development)

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nuance-dev/Web.git
cd Web
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open Web.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run (⌘R)

## Architecture

Web follows MVVM architecture with SwiftUI and Combine:

```
Web/
├── Models/           # Data models (Tab, Bookmark, etc.)
├── Views/           # SwiftUI views and components
├── ViewModels/      # Business logic and state management
├── Services/        # Core services (Download, History, etc.)
├── AI/             # Local AI integration
└── Utils/          # Utilities and extensions
```

### Key Components

- **TabManager**: Handles tab lifecycle and hibernation
- **WebView**: SwiftUI wrapper around WKWebView
- **MLXRunner**: Local AI model execution
- **DownloadManager**: File download handling
- **BookmarkService**: Bookmark management

## AI Features

Web integrates local AI capabilities using Apple's MLX framework and Swift examples:

- **Framework**: [Apple MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) with [MLX Swift Examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples)
- **Models**: Gemma and other compatible models
- **Inference**: MLX-optimized for Apple Silicon
- **Privacy**: All AI processing happens locally

### Code Standards

- Swift 6 with strict concurrency
- Zero warnings/errors policy
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
- Memory-efficient tab management
